# java-to-cpp - Tutorial on Learning C++ after Java

This tutorial contains three main parts:

1. An extensive document on the similarities and differences between the two languages,
intended to be worked through in the process of learning C++. It is for the most
part intended to present all the information needed to be a intermediate C++
programmer, but outside sources and further research are likely required in areas
confusing to the reader if they expect to have a complete understanding of
the material.
(It also includes information on setting up C++ on your computer)
This document is included in four forms

  * A public Google Doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DttXsYMAczmpCq2WIV58W5BPt__cIdgtOCumSTNlnMY/edit?usp=sharing)

  * A text file in this directory named "Java to C++ Information.txt"

  * A .docx file in this directory named "Java to C++ Information.docx"

  * A .pdf file in this directory named "Java to C++ Information.pdf"

2. A checkers game, originally implemented in Java, that has been ported over to C++.
This is intended to show how a large project is made in C++ and to demonstrate
the similarities and differences outlined in 1). Some of the decisions made
in the porting could be made differently, but by the authors calculations they
were the best decisions for the given program.

3. A video documenting how to compile and run both versions of the checkers game
described above (in Java and C++), called Compiling and Running the Checkers Programs.mp4

Have fun learning C++, and I hope this information is helpful!
